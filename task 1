                Photography is the art, practice, and science of creating images by capturing light with a camera. It involves capturing a moment in time, preserving it as a visual record, and often interpreting it artistically. From the early days of daguerreotype to the modern era of digital photography, this medium has evolved significantly, offering endless possibilities for creativity and expression. Whether it's capturing a breathtaking landscape, a candid portrait, or a surreal abstract composition, photography has the power to evoke emotions, tell stories, and connect people across cultures and generations.
